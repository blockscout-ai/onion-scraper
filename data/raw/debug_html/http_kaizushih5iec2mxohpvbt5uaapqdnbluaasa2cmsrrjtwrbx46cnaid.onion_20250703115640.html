<h1>Retired</h1>
<p>At KLOS (Kaizushi's Little Onion Server) I provided a shared Linux system via Tor onion services for money. I started doing this because the space had been vacated by some old friends of mine, and because I was confident that such a system could be practical and secure. While I did do quite a bit to keep the system secure myself, it is important to note that my confidence stems from the work in the Linux, open source, and Gentoo community.
</p><p>I also offered a range of services for users of KLOS as a Linux system, in deploying PHP web applications for their benefit. I would host vendor stores, forums, and such for quite a while. I also hosted some other systems to provide email service, XMPP, and an XMR node. I did have plans to do even more in the future. However, my confidence waned.
</p><p>While I am sure that now just as before that just as much quality work is being done in the open source community, I have come to fear that many governments and other powerful institutions are looking to subvert that. When I started doing this it was my view that such people were stupid, and anyone smart would be a positive and constructive part of the process. I and many others have seen the impotent requests of tyrants to provide backdoors and water down systems. One can be pretty confident that these sorts of people are not going to achieve much.
</p><p>These impotent and foolish people do have money and large scale resources and I have come to fear that they can get the results they want, and are using artifical intelligence to develop, test, and stockpile exploits on our otherwise secure systems. I had issues in the middle of 2024 where protections in the kernel against RCE exploits were triggered multiple times, in a number of different ways, resulting in kernel panics. I believe that they were attempting to get remote code execution, and were close to getting it. Yet, months went past and these crashes happened about five times. It is worth noting that these exploits were probably initiated from shell accounts because of the level of access I provide to customers.
</p><p>While pretty much nobody provides SSH access widely like I would, really with other sites and major players on the darknet it will just take the use of a multitude more exploits for these adversaries to get what they want. Dread, and certain markets have been operating without issue for quite some time. I think actually that some records have been set in the time some of the biggest players here on the DN have been running. It is possible that certain adversaries are leaving them alone as a form of harm reduction, selectively enforcing the law because they prefer the order and rules that Dread and the current popular markets are running by. However, there are many other countries and all of these will be using AI to cause trouble.
</p><p>I do think that trouble is going to come, that over the course of this year there will come a number of takedowns on popular DN sites. Because of these issues I am taking a backseat role from here, and making my presence minimal. While I have a pretty pessimistic outlook in the near term, I do think that in the long run that the battle is ours to win. I simply want to remain until a day comes again that I am confident that I can fight, confident that open source works and that the battle is to be won again.
