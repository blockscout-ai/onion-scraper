		For the first time, the Camaro can be accurately said to be "done." As soon as the torque converter came in, we slapped it on the transmission and shoved the transmission back up into the car. After adding ATF and checking some bolts, I was off for the very first time since buying the car over a year ago. All there was to do then for a week or two was to wait for my brother in law to visit.

		A lot of electrical work has been done since the February post. Here's a short summary begging for additional details. See the previous post for all the other updates. The board we made a while ago for fuel pumps (x3) and radiator fans (x2). In the third picture you see its secure mounting location for about one month before we dig into electrical work even more. As part of getting the rear bumper off for the kill switch (see previous post), we had to pull off the taillight housings.

		It's been 2.5 months since my last update. The car is very nearly driveable at this point. This post covers all the non-electrical updates, and the next covers the electrical ones. New struts for the hood and the rear hatch. We installed a plate on the firewall to cover up most of the holes, and then immediately introduced a hole into it for the main wiring harness. We did the same on the driver side for boost controller and headlight wiring and the throttle cable.
