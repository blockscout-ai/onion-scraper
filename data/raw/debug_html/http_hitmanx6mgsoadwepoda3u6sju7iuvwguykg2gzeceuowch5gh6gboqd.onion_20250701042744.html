<p>    If you’ve ended up here searching for hitman services on Tor, you’re already on the right track. But don’t rush — this is only the first step.
</p>
<p>Pay attention. Before we dive into details, remember this: never share personal information like your name, address, or photos in your initial message. Not until we’ve established a secure, anonymous line of communication. That’s the only way to ensure your privacy and protection — especially from unwanted attention, including law enforcement. For now, just give me a vague outline of what you need.
</p>
<p>The safest approach? Create a TutaMail (tuta.com) account and use it exclusively for our communication. Your personal email? Never. Regular email is an open channel for the authorities, constantly monitored. Leave no trace. Stay smart, stay secure.
